description: |
  VCFcache blueprint derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data (GRCh38).

  NOTE: This blueprint does not contain annotations.
  A combined cache+blueprint bundle can be downloaded from the corresponding cache record.
  See https://github.com/vcftools/vcfcache for more information.
  
  This blueprint contains 99.9M high-quality variant sites filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.001 (0.1% or 1 in 1000 individuals). All genotype
  and INFO fields have been removed, retaining only genomic positions
  (CHROM, POS, REF, ALT). Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: AF-filtered (≥1%), normalized, GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split

  This blueprint serves as a foundation for building annotation caches with
  tools like VEP, SnpEff, or bcftools +split-vep, enabling rapid annotation
  of sample VCFs by pre-annotating common variants (≥1% population frequency).

  Setup:
    vcfcache blueprint-init --doi <DOI> -o <output_dir>

  Usage:
    vcfcache cache-build --db <blueprint_dir> -a annotation.yaml -n <name>
