title: "VCFcache blueprint gnomAD v4.1 joint GRCh37 (AF ≥ 0.01, lifted from GRCh38)"
genome_build: "GRCh37"

description: |
  VCFcache blueprint derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data,
  lifted over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 (hg19).

  This blueprint contains 18.7M high-quality variant sites lifted
  over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 using CrossMap and then filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.01 (1% or 1 in 100 individuals). 
  All genotype and INFO fields have been removed, retaining only 
  genomic positions (CHROM, POS, REF, ALT).
  Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY (GRCh37 coordinates)
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: GRCh38→GRCh37 liftover, AF-filtered (≥0.1%), normalized,
              GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split

  NOTE: This is a liftover from GRCh38. For native GRCh38 analysis, use the
  GRCh38 blueprint instead.

  This blueprint serves as a foundation for building annotation caches with
  tools like VEP, SnpEff, or bcftools +split-vep, enabling rapid annotation
  of sample VCFs using GRCh37/hg19 coordinates with common variants
  (≥1% population frequency).
