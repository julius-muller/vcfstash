title: "VCFcache cache gnomAD v4.1 joint GRCh38 (AF ≥ 0.1) annotated with vep 115.2 -e"
genome_build: "GRCh38"
version: "0.5.1"

description: |
  VCFcache cache derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data (GRCh38).

  NOTE: This upload includes both the annotation cache and its underlying blueprint.
  The blueprint can be used to build new caches with different annotation recipes.

  This underlying blueprint contains 8M high-quality variant sites filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.1 (10% or 1 in 10 individuals). All genotype
  and INFO fields have been removed, retaining only genomic positions
  (CHROM, POS, REF, ALT). Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: AF-filtered (≥10%), normalized, GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split, vep annotated
  Annotation tool: Ensembl VEP 115.2 (via Apptainer)
  VEP cache: Ensembl 115, GRCh38

  VEP Annotations Included (CSQ INFO field):
  - Comprehensive annotation (--everything)
  - HGVS nomenclature (--hgvsg)

  Setup:
    vcfcache cache-build --doi <DOI>

  Usage:
    vcfcache annotate -a <cache_dir> -i sample.vcf.gz -o sample_vc.bcf --stats-dir output/
