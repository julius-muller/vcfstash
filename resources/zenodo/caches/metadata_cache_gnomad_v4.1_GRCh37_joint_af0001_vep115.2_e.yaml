title: "VCFcache cache gnomAD v4.1 joint GRCh37 (AF ≥ 0.001, lifted from GRCh38) annotated with vep 115.2 -e"
genome_build: "GRCh37"
version: "0.5.1"

description: |
  VCFcache cache derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data,
  lifted over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 (hg19).

  NOTE: This upload includes both the annotation cache and its underlying blueprint.
  The blueprint can be used to build new caches with different annotation recipes.

  The underlying blueprint contains 99M high-quality variant sites lifted
  over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 using CrossMap and then filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.001 0.1% or 1 in 1000 individuals). 
  Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY (GRCh37 coordinates)
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: GRCh38→GRCh37 liftover, AF-filtered (≥0.1%), normalized,
              GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split, vep annotated
  Annotation tool: Ensembl VEP 115.2
  VEP cache: Ensembl 115, GRCh37

  NOTE: This is a liftover from GRCh38. For native GRCh38 analysis, use the
  GRCh38 cache instead.

  VEP Annotations Included (CSQ INFO field):
  - Comprehensive annotation (--everything)
  - HGVS nomenclature (--hgvsg)

  Setup:
    vcfcache cache-build --doi <DOI>

  Usage:
    vcfcache annotate -a <cache_dir> -i sample.vcf.gz -o sample_vc.bcf --stats-dir output/
